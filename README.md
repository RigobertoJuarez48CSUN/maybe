Our website assigns roles based on if they register as an admin or as a basic account. Our navigationbar changes what gets loaded based on those roles.
to see this in action all you need to do is register on of each account and then log into each one by one and note what gets display on the navigation bar.
If you use these two accounts you can also see the difference
BASIC
Username: push
Password: 123456

ADMIN
Usernamne: super
password: 123456

using those two accounts the user roles are deminstrated

BASIC
Can only change a car from avialable to not available and can not register a new car

Admin
Can only add or remove cars from the inventory and can not change a car from avialable to not available

If you are not logged in you can not access either one
